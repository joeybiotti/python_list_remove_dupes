# Python List Remove Duplicates 

Yet _another_ python console app. This one will return a list that shouldn't have any duplicates. The list the app pulls numbers from is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 6]`. When the app runs, no duplicates from that list will print to the console. 

I found this exercise <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/15/14-list-remove-duplicates.html">here</a>. There's a lot of fun python exercises there. Try it out!
